# TigerJunction 2.0

## Why a new version?

TigerJunction 2.0 is a full rewrite of the original TigerJunction project. I started 1.0 in 2022 when I had no idea what I was doing. I used the project as a means to learn how to do full-stack web development, but that meant I made a lot of mistakes. While I was happy with the end result, there were a lot of technical issues and bloat which made adding new features difficult.
